# Coding Portfolio

Welcome to my coding portfolio, where I keep a selection of my projects in different coding languages! See below for descriptions of each project.

BATTLESHIP FARRAGUT
  This is a choose-your-own-adventure style game built using Python as a way to practice loops, if/else statements, etc. This game is currently in-progress

WRITING PROMPT GENERATOR
  As well as doing coding, I enjoy writing fiction stories. I designed the writing prompt generator as a way to keep a repository of the writing prompts I see that I like, and as a way to give myself a random one when I need some inspiration.

GENERAL TEST
  The General Test is a test program for the General Amateur Radio License test. It iterates through a series of questions, tells the user when they input a correct or incorrect answer, and tabulates a score. Based on that score, it tells the user if they would've passed the real test.
